## Import and Filter `Instacart` Dataset 
```{r}
data(instacart)
   instacart_df = instacart |> 
     select(
    order_id, order_hour_of_day, product_name, aisle,department) |>         sample_n(size = 10000)
```

## Make a ScatterPlot: When each Product of Alcohol was ordered 

```{r}
instacart_df  |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Product: ", product_name, "\nwhen ordered: ", order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  filter(department=="alcohol") |> 
  mutate(product_name = fct_reorder(product_name, order_hour_of_day)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~product_name, y = ~order_hour_of_day, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", text = ~text_label,alpha = 0.5) |> 
    layout(xaxis = list(tickangle = 35))
```

## Make a BarPlot: Count on the Number of Orders of each Aisle in Bakery Department 
```{r}
instacart_df |> 
  filter(department=="bakery") |>
  count(aisle) |>
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |>
  plot_ly(x = ~aisle, y = ~n, color = ~aisle, type = "bar", colors = "viridis") |> 
    layout(xaxis = list(tickangle = 35))
```
## Make a BoxPlot: When the Products of each Department were Ordered 
```{r}
instacart_df  |>  
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, order_hour_of_day)) |>  
  plot_ly(x = ~department, y = ~order_hour_of_day, color = ~department, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```
