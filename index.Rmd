# This is Amy's Website for Self-introduction

Hi everyone, this is Amy and I generally made this website for introducing myself. There are several sections for my introduction: [my pronouns and current situation](#my-pronouns-and-current-situation), [my hobbies](#my-hobbies), [my room](#my-room) and [my academic experience](#my-academic-experience). 

Here is my self-portrait:
